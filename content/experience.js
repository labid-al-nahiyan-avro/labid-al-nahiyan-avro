   `points` are the bullets. One sentence each, and lead with what you did
   rather than what the team wanted.

   `metric` is optional and renders the only chart on the site: a before/after
   pair drawn to scale. Use it ONLY where you have two real measured numbers.
   `lowerIsBetter: true` means a smaller bar is the better result.

      /* HOW THIS IS PHRASED, AND WHY IT MATTERS.
         The ranking is a TEAM submission, not an individual one, and the
         submission itself was handled by colleagues. The site says so. An
         overstated claim on a verifiable public benchmark is the fastest way
         to lose a committee, and NIST MINEX III results are published — a
         professor can look them up in a minute.
         Role on it: data preparation and model training. */
