/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   tags.js — which colour a category, a field or a tool is drawn in.

   Tags are coloured by WHAT THEY ARE, not by which section they appear in.
   `Computer vision` is the same teal in Research, in Work and in Skills, so
   one colour can be followed down the whole deck as a single thread. The
   seven colours themselves live in assets/css/tokens.css.

   HOW A TAG FINDS ITS FAMILY
   1. an exact match against the lists below, ignoring case
   2. failing that, the longest keyword that appears inside the label
   3. failing that, `fallback`

   So "PyTorch" matches exactly, and "Loss design for crowds" would still be
   caught by the "loss design" keyword. Longest-wins is what stops the "c"
   in the languages list from claiming every label with a c in it.

   ADDING A TAG
   Write it into the family it belongs to, lower case. If nothing fits, put it
   in the closest family rather than inventing an eighth — seven is the point
   at which a taxonomy stops reading as one and starts reading as confetti.
