/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   overview.js — the statement, and the figures block that is currently off.

   `statement` is live: one sentence above the bio, saying what the work is.

   `facts` and `highlights` — the four figures and the three linked lines —
   are BEHIND `show: false` AND ARE NOT ON THE PAGE.

   WHY THEY WERE SWITCHED OFF. They were built for a reader who would not
   scroll: four numbers and three lines that each jumped to the section
   proving them. What they actually produced was a dashboard at the top of an
   academic homepage — a KPI strip and a bulleted feature list, which is the
   shape of a product landing page and not the shape of anything a professor
   or a committee has ever seen on a personal page. An academic homepage is a
   portrait, a two-or-three paragraph bio, contact details and a CV link; the
   evidence lives in Research, Experience and Education, where a reader
   already knows to look for it.

   Nothing was lost by removing them. Every figure was a restatement of
   something further down the page, which was the rule for this file and is
   now the argument against the block:

       5th NIST MINEX III  →  Experience → TigerIT → points[0]
       −41% FNMR           →  Experience → TigerIT → metric (drawn as a chart)
       1 IEEE paper        →  Research → publications, and the News entry
       3.62 / 4.00         →  Education → BUET → result

   THE RULE STILL HOLDS IF THEY EVER COME BACK: every figure must already be
   true somewhere else in /content, each entry names its source in `from:`,
   and it stops being an overview at five. Set `show: true` to restore it.
