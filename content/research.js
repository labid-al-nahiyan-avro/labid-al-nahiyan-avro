   research.js — the Research section.

   THE SECTION IS SPLIT IN TWO, AND THE SPLIT IS THE POINT.
   `groups` below decides the order and the wording of the two sub-lists;
   every item names which one it belongs to with `status`:

       status: "ongoing"   still running, with no result to claim yet
       status: "done"      finished — published, accepted, or defended

   Ongoing is printed first. `groups` decides that, and `items` decides the
   order inside each group — keep the array in page order and the card numbers
   run 01, 02, … straight down the section.

   A reader who wants to know what is finished should never have to infer it
   from a date. Nothing that is merely planned goes in `ongoing` — ongoing
   means work that exists and is being done now.

   Each item is a card in an editorial list. Collapsed it shows only:

       number · status · title · one-line description · meta · tags · +

   `areas` are the coloured tags under the row. Their colour comes from the
   field itself, not from this section — see content/tags.js.

   Everything in `details` is behind the +. Keep each detail field to one or
   two sentences; the paper is where the long version lives.

   `details.venue` is where the whole publication record goes — conference,
   track, place, dates, identifiers. One card should answer every question a
   committee has about where a piece of work landed, so they never have to
   go looking for it elsewhere on the page.

   `details.results` is the measured outcome. LEAVE IT BLANK IF THERE IS NO
   REAL NUMBER — an empty field disappears, an invented one is a lie. An
   ongoing item usually has no results, and that is the correct state for it.

   `kind: "thesis"` gives an item the THESIS label instead of a number, so it
   does not read as just another project.

The first is adversarial and distributional robustness in biometrics: at TigerIT I built a loss for the non-linear elastic distortion and rotational variance that dominate real fingerprint capture, and the same question — what is this system actually optimizing for, and what does that miss — is the one I want to ask about attacks on it. The second is evaluation: the DSAA paper names a failure mode in LLM refusals and gives it three metrics, because a failure nobody can measure is a failure nobody fixes.",
