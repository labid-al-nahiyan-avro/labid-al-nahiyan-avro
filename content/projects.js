/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   projects.js — the Projects section.

   THIS SECTION EXISTS TO ANSWER ONE QUESTION: can this person build things?

   The rule here is stricter than for the rest of the site: nothing goes in
   without a public repository a reader can open. A described project with no
   code is a claim; a repository is evidence. `href` is therefore required —
   the whole card is the link, and clicking anywhere on it opens the repo.

   WHICH ACCOUNT A REPOSITORY SITS ON IS NOT SAID, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE.
   Some of these live on an earlier GitHub account. Explaining that in `meta`
   put a small apology under half the cards — a reader who follows the link
   lands on working code either way, and one who does not follow it did not
   need the footnote. `meta` carries the language and the year, which is what
   someone scanning this section is actually reading it for.
   TEAM PROJECTS SAY SO, IN `meta`. Three of these were built with other
   people and the repository sits under a teammate's account or a team org.
   That is written on the card rather than left to be discovered by whoever
   opens the commit history — the same rule the NIST claim in Experience
   follows. Nobody has ever been hurt by saying who they worked with; the
   opposite is not true.

   ORDER IS REVERSE-CHRONOLOGICAL, strongest first inside a year. It is the
   only ordering that does not require defending.
