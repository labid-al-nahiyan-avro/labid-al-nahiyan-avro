   _archive.js — everything cut from the site, kept so it is not lost.

   NOTHING IMPORTS THIS FILE. It is a drawer, not content. Move an entry back
   into the live file it came from if a situation ever calls for it — a
   different application, a job, a grant.

   THE RULE THAT PRODUCED IT
   Every item on the site was scored 1–100 for relevance to one specific
   goal — a Fall 2027 PhD application in AI security and biometrics/applied
   vision — and anything under 70 was cut. The score is not a judgement of the
   work; a hackathon win is a real achievement. It is a judgement of whether it
   helps a committee decide, and most things do not.

   The bar exists because a portfolio is read in about thirty seconds and every
   weak item costs attention that a strong one needed. Four excellent things
   read as excellent. Four excellent things plus six average ones read as
   average.

  /* SHOP GENIE, BIDIRECTIONAL ROBOT (BABO) AND NERDHERD WERE PUT BACK on the
     live site and are no longer archived. They were cut on the grounds that
     they argue for a product engineer rather than a researcher, which was a
     defensible read of a three-item section and a wrong one for a seven-item
     one: a Projects section that shows only what is on-thesis reads as someone
     with three artifacts, not as someone with focus. All three have public
     repositories under teammates' accounts, found in the CV PDFs, and the
     cards say plainly that they were team projects.

     The reasoning that cut them is worth keeping, because it is the reasoning
     that would cut them again from a shorter section:

       Shop Genie   45  retrieval quality over 10,000 listings is a real
                        engineering problem, but the artifact is a shopping
                        assistant — it argues for a product engineer, and the
                        RAG angle is better carried by the security work.
       BABO         40  hierarchical Q-learning on a custom chassis is
                        genuinely interesting and genuinely unrelated to the
                        stated direction.
