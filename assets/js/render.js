/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   render.js — turns the files in /content into the page.

   There is no portfolio text in this file. To change wording, edit /content.

   LAYOUT MODEL
   A horizontal deck of seven sections. Each is one deck-width wide and
   scrolls vertically on its own:

       horizontal  =  section to section
       vertical    =  content inside a section

   So a section is written here as an ordinary vertical column. It may be
   taller than the screen — that is expected, and it is why sections scroll.

   THE LIST IS THE UNIT
   Research, work, experience, education and news are all the same shape: an
   editorial list of rows separated by hairlines, not a grid of cards. A row
   is `number · title · one line · area`, with a `+` when there is more. Keep
   it that way — cards are what make a portfolio look like every other one.

   Moving between sections is done by the fixed edge navigation (left and
   right, vertically centred), the numbered header nav, or the arrow keys.
   Sections carry no controls of their own.

/* ---------- icons ----------
   Five line marks, drawn here rather than pulled from a library: the site has
   no dependencies and five glyphs do not justify starting. All are one stroke
   weight in currentColor at 13px, so they sit as quiet punctuation in front
   of the contact text rather than as logos.

   THERE IS NO .svg FILE FOR THESE. Editing one means editing this object.
   (The sun and moon live in theme.js; the favicon is a data URI in both
   index.html and photography.html.)

   HOW TO WRITE AN ENTRY. Three forms, in order of how often you want them:

     name: '<circle .../><path .../>'                inner markup, 16×16 grid
     name: { paths: '…', viewBox: '0 0 24 24' }      a different grid
     name: { paths: '…', solid: true }               a filled icon, not stroked

   The default is stroke-drawn on a 16×16 grid, because that is what the other
   five are and what `.icon` in site.css is set up to paint: it forces
   `fill: none; stroke: currentColor`. **A filled icon pasted in without
   `solid: true` renders completely invisible** — the CSS overrides its fill,
   and it looks exactly like the edit did nothing. That was worth a comment.

   Pasting a whole `<svg>…</svg>` document is handled rather than punished:
   `icon()` unwraps it, adopts its viewBox, and warns once in the console. It
   still reads better to paste the inner markup. */

const ICONS = {
  /* Solid 24×24 glyphs. These were stroke-drawn abstractions before — a
     circle on a line standing in for GitHub, an outlined square for LinkedIn —
     which read as decoration rather than as the services they point at. On a
     CV the reader should recognise a Scholar profile without reading the
     label beside it.

     Solid rather than outlined because these are brand marks and brand marks
     are drawn as filled silhouettes; `solid: true` is what tells site.css to
     paint them instead of stroking them. See the note above `icon()`. */
